# Part B – Individual Reflection

## Peer Review of Group Members
As this project was completed individually, there are no other group members to review. All work, including design, coding, testing, and documentation, was carried out solely by me.

## Personal Contribution
I was responsible for all aspects of this project, including:

- **Project Setup:** Created the project structure with `templates`, `static`, and `venv`.
- **Frontend Development:** Designed `index.html`, styled it with `style.css`, and implemented the game logic using `script.js`.
- **Backend Development:** Developed `app.py` using Flask to serve the web app.
- **Testing & Debugging:** Tested the game logic, fixed template and emoji display issues, and ensured the win condition worked.
- **Documentation:** Wrote `README.md` and this reflection.

## Strengths
- Strong problem-solving skills in debugging both Python/Flask and JavaScript issues.
- Effective integration of frontend and backend technologies.
- Clear and well-structured code with comments and proper naming conventions.

## Areas for Improvement
- Could improve the visual design and responsive layout of the game.
- Could implement automated tests to reduce manual testing effort.
- Future projects could include more advanced game mechanics or multiple levels.

## Learning Experiences
- Learned how to combine **Flask with a static frontend** effectively.
- Gained experience in **state management and DOM manipulation** in JavaScript.
- Learned to handle **emoji encoding and font compatibility issues**.
- Improved understanding of **Git, GitHub, and version control workflow**.
- Developed skills in writing clear **documentation and project reflection**.
